<h1>have you ever made pizza from scratch?</h1>
<h2>yea, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
<h3>like, how if you put the sauce on it first, before you mkae the base it doesn't work?</h3>
<h4>or, if you put the cheese on then the suace it's messed up too`</h4>

<!-- add paragraphs here-->

<p>making a pizza is similar to coding. there are certain things we have to do first. Like making the base,
letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do 
start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have everything you need to make many different pizzas using the same base
structure that is set up before hand.</p>
